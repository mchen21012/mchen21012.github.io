            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>
                I am a senior at Cornell University's College of Arts and Sciences. I am majoring in English and Information Science and minoring in Computer Science and Education. 
                My primary interest in English is 20th Century American and British Literature, but I also have a strong interest in American theatre. In Information Science, I am 
                currently fulfilling my concentration in Networks, Crowds, and Markets.
            </p>
            <p>
                Outside of class, I am the vice president of Cornell Piano Society and the secretary of Von Cramm Cooperative Hall. As someone who wishes to continue her passion 
                for piano, I teach and mentor students interested in piano. I also accompanied for Cornell's theatre production of <i>Mr. Burns.</i> In my free time, I like to 
                brainstorm new story ideas and write about them.

            <h2>Goals in the Future</h2>
            <div id="education-container">
                <h3>Education</h3>
                <p>
                    One of my goals in the future is to become an educator in literature. My middle school and high school English teachers played an essential role in inciting my interest in literature. 
                    Thus, I would like to do the same by spreading my own passion for literature to the future generation of students. Furthermore, more and more people (including myself) are studying STEM fields. 
                    Many claim that the humanities are insignificant and useless. However, literature (and of course, history) has played an integral part in shaping our society. Therefore, I want to be an 
                    individual who educates others on the importance and beauty of literature and the arts. I hope that more people will discover the joys of reading and writing. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Furthermore, I believe that we can do much more in ensuring that all students, regardless of class, gender, sexual orientation, race or religion, can receive a quality education. 
                    Using culturally relevant teaching methods and theories of critical pedagogy, I believe that I can make a significant impact in the lives of youths who genuinely design to learn.

                <h3>Video Game Scripting</h3>
                <p>
                    One of my future goals is to become a professional video game writer. Ever since I was a child, I have been enamored by video games. In particular, I am fascinated by Japanese 
                    role-playing game, which heavily depends on a storyline. As a creative writer, I would love to utilize my writing skills to create new and unique games for people to play. 
                    Moreover, I would also like to integrate educational aspects into video games. Children should not be prevented from having fun; thus, I hope that I can create video games that 
                    are both fun and intellectually stimulating. Playing video games has brought so much joy into my life. As a result, I hope to spread this joy to the future generation 
                    of gamers.
