                I am a senior at Cornell University's College of Arts and Sciences. I am majoring in English and Information Science and minoring in Computer Science and Education. 
                Concurrently, I am pursuing a Master of Engineering (M.Eng) in Computer Science with a focus on artificial intelligence and video game development.  
                My primary interest in English is 20th Century American and British Literature, but I also have a strong interest in American theatre. In Information Science, 
                I am fulfilling my concentration in Networks, Crowds, and Markets.

                Outside of class, I am the vice president of Cornell Piano Society and the secretary and webmaster of Von Cramm Cooperative Hall. As someone who wishes to continue her passion 
                for piano, I teach and mentor students interested in piano. I also accompanied for Cornell's theatre production of <i>Mr. Burns.</i> In my free time, I like to 
                brainstorm new story ideas and write about them as well as read and analyze prose literature and psychology texts.

                <h3>Video Game Writing/Scripting</h3>
                <p>
                    One of my future goals is to become a professional video game writer. Ever since I was a child, I have been enamored by video games. In particular, I am fascinated by Japanese 
                    role-playing games, which depend heavily on a storyline. As a creative writer, I would love to utilize my writing skills to create new and unique games for people to play. 
                    Moreover, I would also like to integrate educational aspects into video games. Children should not be prevented from having fun; thus, I hope that I can create video games that 
                    are both fun and intellectually stimulating. Furthermore, I want to make games that combat stereotypes and harmful norms as video games can greatly shape the ideologies of the 
                    players. Playing video games has brought so much joy into my life and has made me the person I am today. As a result, I hope to spread this joy to the future generation 
                    of gamers.

                <h3>Education and Literature</h3>
                <p>
                    One of my goals in the future is to become an educator in literature. My middle school and high school English teachers played an essential role in inciting my interest in reading 
                    and analyzing literature. Consequently, I would like to do the same by spreading my passion for literature to the future generation of students. Furthermore, more and more people 
                    (including myself) are pursuing an education and career in STEM. However, some people who are in STEM feel obligated to stay on this track because of the stigma that the humanities are 
                    insignificant and useless. However, literature, history, art and philosophy have played an integral part in shaping our society. Therefore, I want to be an individual who educates 
                    others on the importance and beauty of literature and the arts. I hope that more people will discover the joys of reading and writing and the impact literature has on the world. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Furthermore, I believe that we can do much more in ensuring that all students, regardless of class, gender, sexual orientation, race or religion, can receive a quality education. 
                    Using culturally relevant teaching methods and theories of critical pedagogy, I believe that I can make a significant impact on the lives of youths who genuinely desire to learn.
